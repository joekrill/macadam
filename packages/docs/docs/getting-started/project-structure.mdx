# Project Structure

Macadam is a monorepo that uses [Yarn Package Manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [it's workspaces feature](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces) to organize code and provide tooling and scripts.

The basic folder structure highlighting the most important paths:

```
├── docs
├── packages
│   ├── api-server
│   ├── client-web
├── services
│   ├── caddy
│   ├── clickhouse
│   ├── glitchtip
│   ├── ...
├── package.json
├── docker-compose.yml
```

- `packages/` - the root folder that contains individual yarn workspaces
- `packages/api-server/` - source code for the API server
- `packages/client-web/` - source code for the frontend web client
- `packages/docs/` - project documentation
- `services/` - configuration, scripts, and other files needed for running external services.
- `package.json` - root-level package.json
- `docker-compose.yml` - docker compose definition for the default development environment.
