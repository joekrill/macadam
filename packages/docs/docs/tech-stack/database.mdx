# Database

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) is used by the API server, Kratos, Plausible Analytics, and GlitchTip. Each application is it's own database

[pgweb](https://sosedoff.github.io/pgweb/) is a web-based client for PostgreSQL. This allows browsing and querying the database directly to aid in debugging and development. Visit <https://pgweb.localtest.me> to access the running pgweb instance.
