# Error Reporting

[GlitchTip](https://glitchtip.com) is used for error reporting collection and analysis. GlitchTip is a branch of, and (currently) compatible with, [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) - and the reporting clients use the Sentry.io SDKS. Switching to Sentry would simply require changing the DSNs used.
